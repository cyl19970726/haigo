top_issues:
  - id: qa-1
    severity: medium
    description: 'Large document hashing executes synchronously on the main thread, violating the performance constraint for â‰¤200MB uploads.'
    impact: 'Users will see UI freezes during hashing, risking browser timeouts and poor UX for required documentation sizes.'
    recommendation: 'Move BLAKE3 hashing into a Web Worker or streaming workerized flow so hashing no longer blocks rendering.'
    refs:
      - apps/web/lib/crypto/blake3.ts

    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: qa-2
    severity: medium
    description: 'Story-defined Playwright/Cypress E2E coverage and accessibility assertions remain unimplemented.'
    impact: 'Regression risk remains high for wallet, upload, and transaction flows without UI-level automated coverage.'
    recommendation: 'Add the promised E2E suite and extend component tests to cover network mismatch and error paths.'
