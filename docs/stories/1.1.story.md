# Story 1.1: Monorepo & CI/CD Foundations

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** platform engineering team member,
**I want** to establish the monorepo structure, shared dependency management, and continuous integration pipelines,
**so that** Move contracts, backend services, and frontend clients can be developed collaboratively with automated quality gates.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo initialization provides `move/`, `apps/web`, `apps/bff`, and `packages/shared` workspaces with runnable bootstrap scripts.
2. Installation and environment scripts cover Move, backend, and frontend dependencies, with README instructions for local execution.
3. CI/CD executes Move compile/tests, backend lint/tests, and frontend lint/build gates; merges require all stages to pass.
4. Pipelines publish build artifacts or deployment bundles and document their locations in logs or documentation.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Establish workspace scaffolding (AC: 1)
  - [x] Initialize root `package.json` with npm workspaces covering `move`, `apps/web`, `apps/bff`, and `packages/shared` [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]
  - [x] Create directory skeletons with placeholder READMEs or index files for each workspace [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]
  - [x] Add root tooling folder placeholder for future lint/CI utilities [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]
- [x] Provide Move workspace baseline (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add `Move.toml` with package metadata and default addresses to enable `aptos move compile` [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]
  - [x] Scaffold `sources/` and `scripts/` directories with stub modules or documentation
  - [x] Define npm script (or package runner alias) to invoke `aptos move test`
- [x] Bootstrap backend and frontend apps (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Configure `apps/web` with Next.js starter (TypeScript, App Router, i18n placeholders) and shared lint rules [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]
  - [x] Configure `apps/bff` with NestJS starter (modules/common/testing folders) and default configuration files [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]
  - [x] Ensure each workspace exposes `pnpm dev`/`pnpm lint`/`pnpm test` scripts referenced from root scripts
- [x] Implement dependency and environment setup (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create root `scripts/setup-local.sh` (or equivalent) to install the Aptos Move CLI via Homebrew, install pnpm dependencies, and document Docker fallback commands for CI parity. [Source: docs/runbook.md#4-move-合约流程]
  - [x] Document environment variables for Postgres, Hasura, BFF, and media storage in `.env.example` [Source: docs/architecture/6-部署与环境.md]
  - [x] Update root README with setup, bootstrap, and troubleshooting steps aligned with brew-first tooling and optional Docker Compose usage. [Source: docs/architecture/6-部署与环境.md]
- [x] Configure CI/CD pipeline (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Add GitHub Actions workflow with `move-test`, `backend-test`, and `frontend-build` jobs gating merges [Source: docs/architecture/6-部署与环境.md]
  - [x] Each job installs dependencies via shared setup script and runs `aptos move test`, backend lint/test, and frontend lint/build respectively [Source: docs/architecture/6-部署与环境.md]
  - [x] Upload artifacts (Move build output, BFF Docker image, Next.js build) and record their storage paths in action logs or README deployment notes [Source: docs/architecture/6-部署与环境.md]
- [x] Verify cross-workspace scripts and documentation (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Run the setup script and CI jobs locally (or via workflow_dispatch) to validate commands succeed and artifacts generate
  - [x] Confirm README references match actual commands and artifact locations, updating documentation as needed [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights**: No previous stories exist; this is the first story in Epic 1.
- **Data Models**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.
- **API Specifications**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.
- **Component Specifications**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.
- **File Locations**:
  - Follow monorepo layout with `move/`, `apps/web/`, `apps/bff/`, `packages/shared/`, `docs/`, and optional `tooling/` directories managed by npm workspaces. [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]
- **Testing Requirements**:
  - CI pipeline must execute Move compilation/tests, backend lint/test, and frontend lint/build stages before merge approval. [Source: docs/architecture/6-部署与环境.md]
- **Technical Constraints**:
  - 本地 Move CLI 采用 Homebrew 安装：`brew install aptos`，完成后运行 `aptos --version` 验证版本；Docker 仅保留作 CI 或备用环境。 [Source: docs/runbook.md#4-move-合约流程]
  - MVP 环境兼容性：当前仅在 macOS 14.x（Apple Silicon M4）验证通过，其他平台待后续扩展。
  - Use GitHub Actions (or Aliyun pipeline equivalent) with staged jobs producing Move build artifacts, BFF containers, and Next.js static assets controlled via environment variables such as `ENV=dev/testnet`. [Source: docs/architecture/6-部署与环境.md]
  - Maintain unified root scripts for lint/test orchestration across workspaces. [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]
  - 当撰写后续 Move 类故事时，避免要求在模块内部读取 `txn_version`/`event_index` 等事件坐标；这些值由 Indexer 在链下持久化，符合数据模型定义。 [Source: docs/architecture/4-链下服务与数据流.md#4-2-数据模型-prisma-postgres]
  - 权限校验应复用 `haigo::registry` 资源中的表访问模式（如 `register_seller` 中的 `table::contains` 检查），而不是依赖仅供链下调用的 `#[view]` 辅助函数。 [Source: move/sources/registry.move:115]
- **Project Structure Notes**: Story aligns with defined repository structure; no conflicts detected. [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]

### Testing
- Ensure GitHub Actions workflow (or equivalent CI) executes `aptos move test`, backend lint/test suite, and frontend lint/build, treating failures as merge blockers. [Source: docs/architecture/6-部署与环境.md]
- Confirm artifacts from each job (Move `build/`, BFF Docker image, Next.js `.next/` output) are archived or published as documented. [Source: docs/architecture/6-部署与环境.md]
