# Story 1.3: Document Developer Workflow & CI Hooks

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** HaiGo product owner enabling delivery teams,
**I want** clear developer workflow documentation and CI hook definitions,
**so that** contributors share the same expectations for quality gates and deployments.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Repository README (or `/docs/development.md`) explains day-one setup, key scripts, and environment expectations (aligns with `docs/architecture.md:21`).
2. CONTRIBUTING guide enumerates coding standards, branching strategy, PR checklist, and references architecture coding-standards (`docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`).
3. CI pipeline definition (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm run move:test`, and surfaces gas reports and OpenAPI validation (`docs/architecture.md:32`).
4. Documentation clarifies testnet auto-deploy vs. mainnet manual approval path per Architecture §12 (`docs/architecture.md:1027`).
5. README includes troubleshooting for wallet tooling (Petra, network switching) referencing Frontend spec flows (`docs/front-end-spec.md:43`).
6. `pnpm run prepush` and Husky hooks documented with instructions to reinstall if hooks fail (`docs/architecture.md:33`).
7. All docs include change history referencing this epic and date stamped updates.
8. Regression: Running CI pipeline locally (if supported) or via dry-run script completes without red builds.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Update README / docs with setup & workflow narrative (AC:1,5,7)
  - [ ] Include sequence from clone → setup → dev commands
  - [ ] Add wallet troubleshooting and Docker tips
- [ ] Draft CONTRIBUTING.md (AC:2)
  - [ ] Outline coding standards & code review expectations
  - [ ] Reference architecture coding standards + tech stack docs
- [ ] Configure CI pipeline (AC:3-4,8)
  - [ ] Add workflow file executing lint/test/move/test + OpenAPI check
  - [ ] Document deployment gating (testnet auto, mainnet manual)
- [ ] Document Husky/prepush behavior (AC:6)
  - [ ] Provide reset commands (`pnpm dlx husky install`) when hooks missing
  - [ ] Include in documentation

## Dev Notes
- Mirror Architecture CI/CD guidance (`docs/architecture.md:1027`) when documenting pipeline approvals.
- Ensure documentation references relevant sections: Move skeleton (§4), BFF OpenAPI (§6), Frontend wallet integration (Frontend Spec user flows).
- Highlight analytics/observability obligations per Architecture §9-12 for developer awareness.

### Testing
- Execute CI workflow steps locally or via dry-run to ensure commands succeed.
- Validate `pnpm run prepush` behaviors and failure messaging documented.
- Optional: run GitHub Actions workflow using `act` for smoke verification.
